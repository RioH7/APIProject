### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a seperate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

### My Process

My page was built using two different html pages and I chose to use a seperate JS file for each one. 'main.js' corresponds to the 'index.html'
page and 'details.js' corresponds to the 'detailsPage.html' page.
